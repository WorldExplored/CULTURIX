# German Language Model Evaluation for Hallucination Detection

This repository contains the code and resources for our paper "A Novel Approach for Evaluating Hallucinations in German Language Large Language Models (LLMs)," submitted to COLM 2024. Our research introduces a groundbreaking method tailored for assessing the accuracy and cultural relevance of German LLMs, addressing the unique challenges posed by the German language's complex grammatical structure and cultural nuances.

## Overview

Our study focuses on developing an advanced LLM specifically for the German language, leveraging the DistilBERT model for its efficiency and adaptability in language tasks. We aim to significantly reduce the occurrence of hallucinations in LLM outputs, ensuring the generated text remains both factually accurate and culturally relevant.

## Repository Structure

- `README.md` - This document providing an overview and instructions for the repository.
- `requirements.txt` - The Python package dependencies required to run the code.
- `data/` - Directory containing the dataset used for training and evaluation (note: due to privacy and licensing, actual data might not be included).
- `src/` - Contains the Python scripts for model training, evaluation, and utility functions.
  - `model_training.py` - Script for training the DistilBERT model on our dataset.
  - `data_preparation.py` - Utility functions for data loading and preprocessing.
- `notebooks/` - Jupyter notebooks illustrating the model's usage and evaluation results.
- `results/` - Directory where training results and evaluation metrics are saved.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have Python 3.6+ installed on your system. You can install the necessary packages using:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Training the Model

To start training the model with the provided dataset, run:

```bash
python src/model_training.py
```

This script will preprocess the data, train the model, and save the trained model along with evaluation metrics in the `results/` directory.

### Evaluation

The training script automatically evaluates the model on a test set and prints out accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Further analysis can be performed using the Jupyter notebooks in the `notebooks/` directory.

## Contributing

We welcome contributions to improve the model and its evaluation. Please feel free to submit issues and pull requests.
